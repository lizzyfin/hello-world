classic hello world example to see how github works

Hey Everybody - 

I'm a Web Developer from Pennsylvania, USA. 

2017 will see me increasing my knowledge of front end development as I work on skills via FreeCodeCamp, et al..

Looking forward to getting and giving coding/programming help via Twitter.

Thanks for reading!
